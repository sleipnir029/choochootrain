# DEVIATIONS.md

Tracks places where implementation deviates from `PRX_PREDICTOR_SPEC.md` or `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Every deviation needs an entry with reasoning, so we can trace back why a choice was made.

---

## When to add a deviation entry

Add an entry HERE before making the change, when implementation:
- Contradicts something stated in the SPEC
- Requires a schema change (any DDL not in ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Requires a different library than the one in CLAUDE.md's tech stack
- Changes user-visible UX in a non-trivial way
- Discovers that vlrggapi or another upstream behaves differently than expected
- Punts a feature documented in the SPEC to a later phase

For trivial fixes (typos in comments, version bumps to patch releases, file renames within a module), don't bother — keep this file signal, not noise.

---

## Approval gates

- **Minor deviation** (single function, no schema change, no user-visible effect): log entry, proceed
- **Material deviation** (schema, library, UX, significant scope change): log entry, **stop and ask Rahat** before proceeding

If unsure which category applies, treat it as material and ask.

## Entry format

```
### YYYY-MM-DD — <short title>

**Phase / Task:** P{X}.T{Y}

**Spec said:**
<quote or paraphrase the relevant SPEC or ARCHITECTURE section>

**What was actually done:**
<what the implementation does instead>

**Why:**
<the discovery that forced the change — be specific>

**Impact:**
<does this affect other phases? schema? UI? performance?>

**Rahat approval:** yes / no / N/A (N/A only for minor deviations)

**Related commit:** `<short SHA>`
